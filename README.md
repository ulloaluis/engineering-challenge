# Carta Engineering Challenge

## Running the Applications
### Backend
Be sure you have python and the flask module installed. Then, run:

    $ env FLASK_APP=api.py flask run

## Special Instructions
If you would like to run the API tests (apitests.py), you will have to install Flask-Testing.

    $ pip install Flask-Testing

## Data Sources
- Harry Potter Data - https://www.potterapi.com/ (specifically from the data/ folder, which I assumed was complete/sufficient)

## Resources Used
- Link to the resources you used here, if any.

Nothing beyond Flask documentation and stackoverflow posts for miscellaneous bugs.
